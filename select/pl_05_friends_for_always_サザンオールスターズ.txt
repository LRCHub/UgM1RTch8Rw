Anytime you're in need of a friend
Anywhere I'll be right by your side
No matter the need, you're important to me
I'll be with you wherever you go
今は別々の道をゆく (仲間たち)
相も変わって どうしてる今頃?
きみのことだから心配なんかしてないよ だけど
As the waves crash 'round,
the wind will protect you
As the rain pours down, let it in
Just feel it now, the sun will light the way
Like so many times
before you can always count on me
Anytime you're in need of a friend
Anywhere I'll be right by your side
No matter the need, you're important to me
I'll be with you wherever you go
Between you and I we can say we've done it all
Taking our time
to ensure adventure's always on our mind
And as we find ourselves
in such different places
on this journey of life
I'm always here for you, yo
たとえ 何があってもなくても遠慮はいらない
心にいつも君が見てくれている
そう思えるだけで 乗り越えていける
Anytime you're in need of a friend
Anywhere I'll be right by your side
No matter the need, you're important to me
I'll be with you wherever you go
If we can't be together,
float in the wind like a feather
Our paths will cross again someday
and so it will be
Free as a bird in 風 I can feel your 呼ぶ声
Oceans apart will never drown this bond
we share in our heart
If we can't be together floating
in the wind like a feather
Our paths will cross again someday
and so it will be
Free as a bird in 風 仲間の呼ぶ声
Oceans apart will never drown this bond
we share in our heart
If we can't be together floating
in the wind like a feather
Our paths will cross again someday
and so it will be
Free as a bird in 風 I can feel your 呼ぶ声
Oceans apart will never drown this bond
we share in our heart
